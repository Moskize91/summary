You are creating a tiered verification strategy for reviewing compressed text. Your job is to analyze the chunks in this narrative clue and generate a structured checklist with THREE verification levels based on each chunk's retention level.

**CRITICAL: Output your entire verification strategy in the SAME LANGUAGE as the source text provided.** This ensures terminology, key terms, and phrasing remain consistent with the original book text without translation loss. Detect the language from the source text and use it throughout your output.

## Input Data

The user will provide a narrative clue presented as **continuous book-like text** with chunk boundaries marked using XML-style tags.

**XML Markup Format:**
```xml
Regular unmarked text...

<chunk label="Chunk label" retention="detailed">
Text belonging to this chunk...
</chunk>

More unmarked text...

<chunk label="Another chunk" retention="focused">
More chunk text...
</chunk>
```

**Chunk Attributes:**
- `label`: Semantic label (required)
- `retention`: verbatim/detailed/focused/relevant (required)

**Reading Tips:**
- Read the text naturally like a book
- Unmarked text provides context (surrounding narrative)
- Marked chunks (`<chunk>`) are the focus points for verification
- If chunks overlap (same text, different attributes), the highest-priority attributes are shown

---

## Simplified Three-Level System

Both retention levels (for user-focused chunks) and importance levels (for book-coherence chunks) are mapped to a unified three-tier verification system:

| retention | importance | Priority Level | Completely Missing | Mentioned but Incomplete |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| verbatim | — | **high (TIER 1a)** | CRITICAL | MAJOR (completeness check) |
| detailed | — | **high (TIER 1a)** | CRITICAL | MAJOR (completeness check) |
| — | critical | **high (TIER 1b)** | CRITICAL | MAJOR |
| focused | — | **medium** | MAJOR | MINOR |
| — | important | **medium** | MAJOR | MINOR |
| relevant | — | **low** | MINOR | MINOR |
| — | helpful | **low** | MINOR | MINOR |

**Merging rule**: When a chunk has both retention and importance attributes, use the **higher priority level** for verification (TIER 1a > TIER 1b > TIER 2 > TIER 3).

**Important principle**: Every chunk must be able to generate at least a MINOR issue. This ensures no chunk is effectively ignored during verification.

**Key differences between TIER 1a and TIER 1b:**
- **TIER 1a (verbatim/detailed)**: Core facts + Completeness check against source text. Student can achieve 100% by copying original text.
- **TIER 1b (critical)**: Core facts + Minor details (at least one). More flexible compression allowed.

## Your Task

Analyze each marked `<chunk>` and assign it to one of THREE tiers based on its attributes:

### TIER 1 (high priority): verbatim OR detailed OR critical

**Two sub-types with different verification strategies:**

#### TIER 1a: verbatim OR detailed chunks
**Verification Condition:** "Core Facts + Completeness Check"
- Must include ALL items from the **core facts list**
- THEN compare with source text for information completeness

**Issue reporting:**
- **If completely missing:** CRITICAL issue
- **If core facts incomplete:** CRITICAL issue
- **If core facts satisfied but information incomplete compared to source:** MAJOR issue (guaranteed minimum)

**Strategy:**
- Extract the original chunk text from the markup (will be provided to reviewer)
- **FIRST, detect if this chunk contains literary/metaphorical content** (see guidelines below)
- Identify core facts (essential information, usually 2-5 items)
- Add completeness check instruction: reviewer must compare compressed text with source text
- The student CAN achieve 100% satisfaction by copying the original text (at the cost of compression ratio)

#### TIER 1b: critical importance chunks
**Verification Condition:** "Core + Minor"
- Must include ALL items from the **core facts list**
- PLUS at least ONE item from the **minor details list**

**Issue reporting:**
- **If completely missing:** CRITICAL issue
- **If mentioned but core incomplete or no minor details:** MAJOR issue

**Strategy:**
- Extract the original chunk text from the markup
- **FIRST, detect if this chunk contains literary/metaphorical content** (see guidelines below)
- Identify core facts (essential information that must be present)
- Identify minor details (supporting details, at least one required)
- Generate precise requirements

**Literary/Metaphorical Content Detection:**

Before extracting core facts, analyze the chunk text for these characteristics:
- **Metaphorical expressions**: 比喻性语言 (e.g., "掘墓人", "最后一根稻草", "凤凰涅槃")
- **Prophetic/foreshadowing tone**: 预示性叙述 (e.g., "命运为...准备了", "历史在等待", "注定要...")
- **Symbolic language**: 象征性表达 (e.g., "黑云压城", "星火燎原")
- **Authorial commentary**: 作者评论 (e.g., "这标志着...", "这意味着...")
- **Dramatic framing**: 戏剧性框架 (e.g., "浴火重生", "命运转折")

If the chunk contains ANY of these, mark it as **[LITERARY]** and follow special extraction rules:

**Special extraction rules for literary chunks:**

1. **Preserve metaphorical expressions in core facts**:
   - DON'T: "某人出生"
   - DO: "命运为王朝准备了'终结者'" (preserve the metaphorical framing)

2. **Capture the tone/function, not just facts**:
   - DON'T: "某事件引发起义"
   - DO: "某事件成为'压垮帝国的最后一根稻草'" (preserve judgmental/conclusive tone)

3. **Include literary language in both core facts AND minor details**:
   - Core facts should capture essential metaphorical meanings
   - Minor details should include vivid metaphors, dramatic descriptions

4. **Add explicit instructions in core facts**:
   - Use quotation marks around key metaphorical terms to signal they must be preserved
   - Example: Core fact: "使用'掘墓人'或类似metaphorical language描述人物的历史角色"

**Example (TIER 1a - detailed/verbatim chunk, factual):**
```
**地主拒绝帮助**

Source text:
<source>
主角的父母死后，他去找地主，请求看在父亲给他当了一辈子佃户的分上，找个地方埋葬父亲，但地主干净利落地拒绝了他。
</source>

Core facts (ALL required):
- 主角父母死后
- 主角去找地主求坟地
- 主角提到父亲当了一辈子佃户
- 地主拒绝了他

Completeness check:
- After verifying core facts, compare the compressed text with source text above
- Check if any substantive information is missing, understated, or significantly altered
- This is a "detailed" chunk - it should preserve ~100% information with rephrasing allowed
- If information is incomplete → report MAJOR issue (guaranteed minimum even if core facts are satisfied)
- The student can achieve 100% satisfaction by preserving the original text closely
```

**Example (TIER 1a - detailed/verbatim chunk, literary):**
```
**命运的预示** [LITERARY]

Source text:
<source>
历史为这个王朝准备了一个终结者：某人。当然他不会想到命运会交给他这样一个重要的任务。这一年，他十七岁。很快一场灾难就要降临到他的身上，但同时，一个伟大的使命也在等待着他，只有像传说中的凤凰一样，历经苦难,投入火中，经过千锤百炼，才能浴火重生，成为光芒万丈的神鸟。来吧，命运之子正在等待着你！
</source>

Core facts (ALL required):
- 使用metaphorical/prophetic language描述主角被命运选中(如"历史准备的终结者"、"命运之子"等)
- 这一年主角十七岁
- Foreshadowing双重命运：一场灾难即将降临 + 一个伟大的使命在等待
- 使用"凤凰"/"浴火重生"等metaphorical imagery描述转变历程

Completeness check:
- After verifying core facts, compare with source text for metaphorical/prophetic language preservation
- Check: Are metaphors like "千锤百炼"、"光芒万丈的神鸟"、"来吧，命运之子" preserved?
- This is a literary chunk - factual substitutions are NOT sufficient
- The prophetic tone and dramatic expressions should be largely preserved
- If tone/metaphors are significantly weakened → report MAJOR issue

Note: This is a literary/prophetic chunk requiring high preservation of style and metaphorical language.
```

**Example (TIER 1b - critical importance chunk):**
```
**主角决定参军**

Source text:
<source>
面对师兄的告发和朝廷的追捕，主角算了一卦，得到"逃跑必死，起义有生机"的启示。他意识到别无选择，只能参加起义军。
</source>

Core facts (ALL required):
- 师兄告发了主角
- 主角算卦得到启示
- 主角决定参加起义军

Minor details (at least ONE required):
- 卦象内容是"逃跑必死，起义有生机"
- 主角意识到别无选择
- 朝廷在追捕主角
```

---

### TIER 2 (medium priority): focused OR important
**Verification Condition:** "Any One"
- Must mention AT LEAST ONE item from the **key points list**

**If none mentioned:** MAJOR issue
**If at least one mentioned but incomplete:** MINOR issue

**Strategy:**
- Extract core meaning without requiring full text
- List key points (any one sufficient)
- Allow semantic equivalence, paraphrasing, reordering

**Example:**
```
**统领审问新兵**

Key points (at least ONE required):
- 统领审问主角
- 主角表现镇定
- 统领想看到慌乱但没看到
- 得知是熟人介绍后相信了
```

---

### TIER 3 (low priority): relevant OR helpful
**Verification Condition:** "Existence"
- Must have ANY form of mention (any phrasing, any detail counts)

**If not mentioned at all:** MINOR issue
**If mentioned in any form (even incomplete):** MINOR issue (but acceptable)

**Strategy:**
- Brief description of what should be present
- Very flexible - any reference counts

**Example:**
```
**主角的家庭背景**

Existence check:
- 文本中必须有关于主角家庭生活的任何描述（任何形式的提及都算满足）
```

### TIER 1 (HIGH PRIORITY - CRITICAL if missing, MAJOR if incomplete)

**For verbatim/detailed chunks:**

**【Chunk label】** [Add [LITERARY] tag if this chunk contains metaphorical/prophetic language]

Source text:
<source>
【Original chunk text extracted from markup】
</source>

Core facts (ALL required):
- 【Core fact 1 - if literary chunk, include metaphorical expressions with quotes】
- 【Core fact 2 - preserve tone/style requirements】
- 【Core fact 3】
- 【...】

Completeness check:
- After verifying core facts, compare the compressed text with source text above
- Check if any substantive information is missing, understated, or significantly altered
- This is a "detailed"/"verbatim" chunk - it should preserve ~100% information with rephrasing allowed
- If information is incomplete → report MAJOR issue (guaranteed minimum even if core facts are satisfied)
- The student can achieve 100% satisfaction by preserving the original text closely

[If literary chunk, add a note:]
Note: This is a literary/[metaphorical/prophetic/symbolic] chunk requiring high preservation of style and [metaphorical/prophetic/symbolic] language.

---

**For critical importance chunks:**

**【Chunk label】** [Add [LITERARY] tag if this chunk contains metaphorical/prophetic language]

Source text:
<source>
【Original chunk text extracted from markup】
</source>

Core facts (ALL required):
- 【Core fact 1 - if literary chunk, include metaphorical expressions with quotes】
- 【Core fact 2 - preserve tone/style requirements】

Minor details (at least ONE required):
- 【Minor detail 1 - include dramatic/metaphorical language if present】
- 【Minor detail 2】
- 【Minor detail 3】

[If literary chunk, add a note:]
Note: This is a literary/[metaphorical/prophetic/symbolic] chunk. Factual substitutions are NOT sufficient. The [metaphorical/prophetic/symbolic] tone and expressions must be preserved.

---

### TIER 2 (MEDIUM PRIORITY - MAJOR if missing)

**【Chunk label】**

Key points (at least ONE required):
- 【Key point 1】
- 【Key point 2】
- 【Key point 3】

---

### TIER 3 (LOW PRIORITY - MINOR if missing)

**【Chunk label】**

Existence check:
- 【Description of what should be present in any form】

---

### NARRATIVE COHERENCE (OPTIONAL - only if this clue has importance chunks)

**When to include this section:**
- ONLY if this clue contains chunks with importance attributes (critical/important/helpful)
- Skip this section entirely if all chunks only have retention attributes

**What to check:**
Identify potential narrative gaps or logical jumps between chunks that could confuse readers:

**【Potential coherence issue description】**
- Expected flow: 【chunk A】 → 【chunk B】 → 【chunk C】
- Potential problem: 【describe what logical connection might be missing】
- Severity: MAJOR or MINOR
- Suggestion: 【what bridging information would help】

(Repeat for each identified coherence issue, typically 0-2 issues per clue)

---
```

---

## Important Guidelines:

1. **Clue naming:** Name based on what the chunks actually discuss (clue's real content), not user's general intent

2. **Tier assignment logic:**
   - retention = verbatim OR detailed → TIER 1a (with completeness check)
   - importance = critical → TIER 1b (with core + minor)
   - retention = focused → TIER 2
   - retention = relevant → TIER 3
   - When a chunk has BOTH retention and importance: use the higher priority tier (1a > 1b > 2 > 3)

3. **Source text extraction:**
   - For TIER 1 (all subtypes): Always extract original text from `<chunk>` tags and place in `<source>` tags
   - For TIER 2-3: No need to quote full text (saves space)

4. **TIER 1a verification (verbatim/detailed chunks):**
   - Core facts: Absolutely essential information (usually 2-5 items)
   - NO minor details list - use completeness check instead
   - Completeness check gives reviewer flexibility to judge "all information" against source text
   - Student can achieve 100% satisfaction by closely preserving original text

5. **TIER 1b verification (critical importance chunks):**
   - Core facts: Absolutely essential information (usually 2-4 items)
   - Minor details: Supporting details that add richness (usually 2-5 items, only need 1)
   - If a chunk is very simple, you can have 1-2 core facts and 1-2 minor details

6. **Key points quantity (TIER 2):**
   - List 2-5 key points
   - Reviewer only needs to find ONE to pass
   - More options = more flexibility for compression

7. **Only use information explicitly stated in the source text** - do not add facts from general knowledge

8. **Generate abstract requirements, not specific phrasings** (for TIER 2):
   - ✅ GOOD: "Multiple family members died in rapid succession"
   - ❌ BAD: "On June 6th father died, June 9th brother died..." (too specific)

9. **Context awareness:**
   - Unmarked text between chunks provides narrative context
   - Use surrounding text to better understand chunk meaning
   - This complete context helps you generate more accurate verification strategies

10. **Every chunk MUST appear in exactly ONE tier** - no chunk should be skipped

11. **Narrative Coherence (for importance chunks only)**:
   - Check if this clue contains chunks with importance attributes (critical/important/helpful)
   - If yes, analyze the logical flow between these chunks in the original text
   - Identify potential narrative gaps:
     - Are there large jumps between chunks that skip important context?
     - Does the story jump from topic A to topic B without explanation?
     - Is there missing motivation for key decisions (especially for importance=critical chunks)?
   - Common coherence issues:
     - **Abrupt topic change**: "After discussing X, suddenly talks about Y without transition"
     - **Missing cause**: "Character decides to do Z, but the triggering event is not mentioned"
     - **Background info timing**: "Background policy P appears out of context without explaining why it matters now"
   - Only flag issues that would genuinely confuse readers
   - Limit to 0-2 coherence issues per clue (don't over-flag)
   - Example:
     ```
     **缺少"元朝抓人政策"与"朱重八决定"的因果连接**
     - Expected flow: 师兄告发 → 算卦 → **元朝抓人政策** → 朱重八意识到危险 → 决定造反
     - Potential problem: 压缩文本在"算卦"之后突然插入"元朝官吏抓人"，读者会困惑为什么突然讲政策背景
     - Severity: MINOR
     - Suggestion: 在提到元朝抓人政策时，加上"此时"或"而且"等过渡词，或说明"这意味着朱重八即使不造反也可能被抓"
     ```

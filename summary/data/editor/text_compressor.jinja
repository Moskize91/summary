## Compression Guidelines

1. **Prioritize user-focused information**: The reader cares most about these threads
2. **Maintain narrative coherence**: Preserve logical connections and cause-effect relationships
3. **Respect thread weights**: Higher-weight threads deserve more space
4. **Be concise but accurate**: Remove redundancy, not meaning

---

## Quality Standards

Your compressed text will be reviewed by specialized thread reviewers. They will check:
- Are critical facts preserved?
- Is the user's reading intent respected?
- Does the text remain logically coherent?

You may go through multiple revision rounds based on their feedback.

## Output Format

The user will provide the original text in their message. Compress it and output:

**Compressed text (plain text, natural Chinese):**

【Your compressed text here - write it as readable prose, not bullet points】

---

**Important:**
- Write naturally in Chinese, as if summarizing for a friend
- Preserve specific details (names, numbers, policies, events) that define the threads
- Remove filler words, redundant descriptions, and tangential content
- Maintain chronological or logical order from the original
- If you must choose between threads, prioritize higher-weighted ones
- Do NOT output JSON or structured format - just write the compressed text directly

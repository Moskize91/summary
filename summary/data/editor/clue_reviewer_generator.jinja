You are creating a tiered verification strategy for reviewing compressed text. Your job is to analyze the chunks in this narrative clue and generate a structured checklist with THREE verification levels based on each chunk's retention level.

**CRITICAL: Output your entire verification strategy in the SAME LANGUAGE as the source text provided.** This ensures terminology, key terms, and phrasing remain consistent with the original book text without translation loss. Detect the language from the source text and use it throughout your output.

## Input Data

The user will provide a narrative clue presented as **continuous book-like text** with chunk boundaries marked using XML-style tags.

**XML Markup Format:**
```xml
Regular unmarked text...

<chunk label="Chunk label" retention="detailed">
Text belonging to this chunk...
</chunk>

More unmarked text...

<chunk label="Another chunk" retention="focused">
More chunk text...
</chunk>
```

**Chunk Attributes:**
- `label`: Semantic label (required)
- `retention`: verbatim/detailed/focused/relevant (required)

**Reading Tips:**
- Read the text naturally like a book
- Unmarked text provides context (surrounding narrative)
- Marked chunks (`<chunk>`) are the focus points for verification
- If chunks overlap (same text, different attributes), the highest-priority attributes are shown

---

## Simplified Three-Level System

Both retention levels (for user-focused chunks) and importance levels (for book-coherence chunks) are mapped to a unified three-tier verification system:

| retention | importance | Priority Level | Completely Missing | Mentioned but Incomplete |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| verbatim | — | **high** | CRITICAL | MAJOR |
| detailed | — | **high** | CRITICAL | MAJOR |
| — | critical | **high** | CRITICAL | MAJOR |
| focused | — | **medium** | MAJOR | MINOR |
| — | important | **medium** | MAJOR | MINOR |
| relevant | — | **low** | MINOR | MINOR |
| — | helpful | **low** | MINOR | MINOR |

**Merging rule**: When a chunk has both retention and importance attributes, use the **higher priority level** for verification.

**Important principle**: Every chunk must be able to generate at least a MINOR issue. This ensures no chunk is effectively ignored during verification.

**Note**: verbatim and detailed are treated identically for AI verification. Word-for-word matching is handled by code post-processing.

## Your Task

Analyze each marked `<chunk>` and assign it to one of THREE tiers based on its attributes:

### TIER 1 (high priority): verbatim OR detailed OR critical
**Verification Condition:** "Core + Minor"
- Must include ALL items from the **core facts list**
- PLUS at least ONE item from the **minor details list**

**If completely missing:** CRITICAL issue
**If mentioned but core incomplete or no minor details:** MAJOR issue

**Strategy:**
- Extract the original chunk text from the markup
- Identify core facts (essential information that must be present)
- Identify minor details (supporting details, at least one required)
- Generate precise requirements

**Example:**
```
**刘德拒绝帮助**

Source text:
<source>
朱重八的父母死后，他去找地主刘德，请求看在父亲给他当了一辈子佃户的分上，找个地方埋葬父亲，但刘德干净利落地拒绝了他。
</source>

Core facts (ALL required):
- 朱重八去找刘德求坟地
- 刘德拒绝了他

Minor details (at least ONE required):
- 朱重八提到父亲当了一辈子佃户
- 刘德的拒绝是"干净利落的"
- 刘德说"关我何事"或"给我干活，我也给过他饭吃"
```

---

### TIER 2 (medium priority): focused OR important
**Verification Condition:** "Any One"
- Must mention AT LEAST ONE item from the **key points list**

**If none mentioned:** MAJOR issue
**If at least one mentioned but incomplete:** MINOR issue

**Strategy:**
- Extract core meaning without requiring full text
- List key points (any one sufficient)
- Allow semantic equivalence, paraphrasing, reordering

**Example:**
```
**郭子兴审问**

Key points (at least ONE required):
- 郭子兴审问朱元璋
- 朱元璋表现镇定
- 郭子兴想看到慌乱但没看到
- 得知汤和介绍后相信了
```

---

### TIER 3 (low priority): relevant OR helpful
**Verification Condition:** "Existence"
- Must have ANY form of mention (any phrasing, any detail counts)

**If not mentioned at all:** MINOR issue
**If mentioned in any form (even incomplete):** MINOR issue (but acceptable)

**Strategy:**
- Brief description of what should be present
- Very flexible - any reference counts

**Example:**
```
**朱重八的家庭**

Existence check:
- 文本中必须有关于朱重八家庭生活的任何描述（任何形式的提及都算满足）
```

## Output Format (Natural language, will be embedded in reviewer prompt)

Structure your output EXACTLY as follows:

```
## Clue: "【Clue theme name based on actual content, 3-8 characters】"

---

### TIER 1 (HIGH PRIORITY - CRITICAL if missing, MAJOR if incomplete)

**【Chunk label】**

Source text:
<source>
【Original chunk text extracted from markup】
</source>

Core facts (ALL required):
- 【Core fact 1】
- 【Core fact 2】

Minor details (at least ONE required):
- 【Minor detail 1】
- 【Minor detail 2】
- 【Minor detail 3】

---

### TIER 2 (MEDIUM PRIORITY - MAJOR if missing)

**【Chunk label】**

Key points (at least ONE required):
- 【Key point 1】
- 【Key point 2】
- 【Key point 3】

---

### TIER 3 (LOW PRIORITY - MINOR if missing)

**【Chunk label】**

Existence check:
- 【Description of what should be present in any form】

---
```

## Important Guidelines:

1. **Clue naming:** Name based on what the chunks actually discuss (clue's real content), not user's general intent

2. **Tier assignment logic:**
   - retention = verbatim OR detailed → TIER 1
   - retention = focused → TIER 2
   - retention = relevant → TIER 3

3. **Source text extraction:**
   - For TIER 1: Extract original text from `<chunk>` tags and place in `<source>` tags
   - For TIER 2-3: No need to quote full text (saves space)

4. **Core vs Minor distinction (TIER 1 only):**
   - Core facts: Absolutely essential information (usually 2-4 items)
   - Minor details: Supporting details that add richness (usually 2-5 items, only need 1)
   - If a chunk is very simple, you can have 1-2 core facts and 1-2 minor details

5. **Key points quantity (TIER 2):**
   - List 2-5 key points
   - Reviewer only needs to find ONE to pass
   - More options = more flexibility for compression

6. **Only use information explicitly stated in the source text** - do not add facts from general knowledge

7. **Generate abstract requirements, not specific phrasings** (for TIER 2):
   - ✅ GOOD: "Multiple family members died in rapid succession"
   - ❌ BAD: "On June 6th father died, June 9th brother died..." (too specific)

8. **Context awareness:**
   - Unmarked text between chunks provides narrative context
   - Use surrounding text to better understand chunk meaning
   - This complete context helps you generate more accurate verification strategies

9. **Every chunk MUST appear in exactly ONE tier** - no chunk should be skipped

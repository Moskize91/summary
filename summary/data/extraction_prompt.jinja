You are reading a long text and need to extract key information while maintaining continuity.

**Task:**
Extract 1-3 key pieces of information from the new text segment that are important for understanding the narrative.

**Requirements:**
1. Each piece of information should be:
   - A meaningful unit (events, character actions, important facts)
   - Concise (one sentence)
   - Connected to the existing working memory

2. For each extracted information, specify which items in working memory it relates to:
   - Use the ID numbers to indicate relationships
   - Use empty array [] if this is a completely new topic
   - Multiple links are allowed if related to several items

3. Do NOT repeat information already in working memory

**Current Working Memory:**
{{ working_memory }}

**New Text Segment:**
{{ new_text }}

**Output Format (JSON only, no other text):**
[
  {
    "content": "brief description of the key information",
    "links": [1, 3]
  }
]

Remember: Extract only the most important information that advances the narrative or adds crucial context.

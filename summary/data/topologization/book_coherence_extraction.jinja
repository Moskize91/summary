You are reading a long text and need to extract essential connective tissue for maintaining the book's narrative coherence.

---

## CONTEXT

These user-focused chunks were already extracted from this text segment:

{% if user_focused_chunks %}
{% for chunk in user_focused_chunks %}
{{ chunk.id }}. [{{ chunk.label }}] {{ chunk.content }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
(No user-focused chunks were extracted from this segment)
{% endif %}

**Current Working Memory:**
{{ working_memory }}

---

## TASK

Extract book-coherence chunks that are ESSENTIAL for understanding the book's logic but were NOT captured in the user-focused chunks above.

Extract 1-3 chunks ONLY if they meet the strict criteria below. If the user-focused chunks already cover the essential connective tissue, output an empty result.

---

## EXTRACTION CRITERIA

### What to extract (book-coherence chunks):

Extract information essential for understanding the book's logic and narrative flow, REGARDLESS of the reader's personal interests. This includes:

- **First introductions** of key concepts, characters, or settings that will be referenced later
- **Causal relationships** that drive the plot or argument forward
- **Context and background** that makes later content comprehensible
- **Turning points or transitions** in the narrative structure
- **Definitions, rules, or constraints** established by the author that affect subsequent content

### What to avoid:

- Information **already captured** in the user-focused chunks above
- Details that **won't affect comprehension** of later content
- Generic filler, repetition, or tangential information
- Content that's interesting but not structurally necessary

### Link criteria:

Connect book-coherence chunks when there are clear **logical dependencies**, **cause-and-effect relationships**, or **narrative continuity** between them.

Also link to user-focused chunks if they provide essential context for each other (e.g., book-coherence chunk explains WHY something in user-focused chunk happened).

---

## IMPORTANCE LEVEL GUIDELINES

Rate each book-coherence chunk (being extracted means it's already important, so use only 3 levels):

- **critical**: Essential setup, major turning points, or causal links that cannot be skipped
- **important**: Key context, definitions, or transitions that significantly aid understanding
- **helpful**: Supplementary background or minor connective tissue

---

## LINK STRENGTH GUIDELINES

Rate each link's dependency strength:

- **critical**: Must understand FROM to understand TO (cannot skip FROM)
- **important**: FROM provides essential context for TO (should not skip FROM)
- **helpful**: FROM and TO are related but both can stand alone (optional connection)

---

**Output Format (JSON only, no other text):**

The user will provide the same text segment in their message. Extract ONLY book-coherence chunks that supplement the user-focused extraction.

CRITICAL: You MUST output in this EXACT structure with "chunks" FIRST, then "links" SECOND:

{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "temp_id": "D",
      "type": "book_coherence",
      "label": "brief topic label (5-15 chars)",
      "content": "full description of the connective information",
      "source_sentences": ["original sentence from text"],
      "importance": "critical"
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {"from": "D", "to": 1, "strength": "important"},
    {"from": 5, "to": "D", "strength": "helpful"}
  ]
}

**If no book-coherence chunks are needed, output:**
{
  "chunks": [],
  "links": []
}

**Field Explanations:**
- "chunks": Array of book-coherence chunks (0-3 chunks, only if essential)
  - "temp_id": Use letters continuing from user-focused chunks (if user had A,B,C then start with D,E,F)
  - "type": MUST be "book_coherence"
  - "label": 5-15 character summary
  - "content": Full one-sentence description
  - "source_sentences": Array of original sentences from the text (copy exact text)
  - "importance": One of "critical", "important", or "helpful"

- "links": Array of relationships between chunks
  - "from" can be: working memory ID (number) OR temp_id (string from user-focused OR book-coherence chunks)
  - "to" can be: working memory ID (number) OR temp_id (string from user-focused OR book-coherence chunks)
  - "strength": One of "critical", "important", or "helpful"
  - Can link book-coherence chunks to user-focused chunks (e.g., "D" to 1)
  - Use empty array [] if no relationships exist

**IMPORTANT:**
1. The order matters! Output "chunks" FIRST, then "links" SECOND.
2. Every chunk MUST have a "type" field set to "book_coherence".
3. Every chunk MUST have an "importance" field with one of the three valid values.
4. Every link MUST have a "strength" field with one of the three valid values.
5. You CAN reference user-focused chunks in your links (using their numeric IDs).
6. Be conservative - only extract what's truly necessary for coherence.

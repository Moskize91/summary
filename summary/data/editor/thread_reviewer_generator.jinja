You are creating a tiered verification strategy for reviewing compressed text. Your job is to analyze the chunks in this narrative thread and generate a structured checklist with different verification levels based on each chunk's retention and importance attributes.

**CRITICAL: Output your entire verification strategy in the SAME LANGUAGE as the source sentences provided in the chunks.** This ensures terminology, key terms, and phrasing remain consistent with the original book text without translation loss. Detect the language from the source_sentences and use it throughout your output.

## Input Data

The user will provide:
- User's reading intention
- A narrative thread containing chunks with:
  - Label, content (summary)
  - Retention level (verbatim/detailed/focused/relevant, or null)
  - Importance level (critical/important/helpful, or null)
  - Source sentences (original text from the book)

---

## Your Task

Analyze each chunk and assign it to one of four verification tiers based on its attributes:

### TIER 1: Critical Details (Highest priority - detailed verification)
**Criteria:** retention IN [detailed, verbatim] OR (retention exists AND importance IN [critical, important])
**Strategy:**
- Attach full original text in `<source>` tags
- Generate precise requirements listing key terms, core logic points
- Example requirement: "Must mention '诛灭元朝' (eliminate Yuan dynasty) AND '利器' (weapon/tool) symbolism"

### TIER 2: Important Facts (Core meaning verification)
**Criteria:** retention=focused OR (retention=detailed/verbatim without importance)
**Strategy:**
- Extract abstract core facts (no full source text)
- Allow semantic equivalence, paraphrasing, reordering
- Example: "Core fact: Zhu Yuanzhang displayed outstanding abilities in the army (brave, strategic, calm)"

### TIER 3: Narrative Logic (Logical presence verification)
**Criteria:** importance exists but NO retention
**Strategy:**
- Generate imperative checkpoints in command form
- Focus on logical connections, not details
- Example: "→ Must explain HOW Zhu Yuanzhang entered Guo Zixing's army (introduction/referral)"

### TIER 4: Optional Context (Nice-to-have)
**Criteria:** retention=relevant OR no attributes at all
**Strategy:**
- Brief description only
- Note: "If missing, minor impact on understanding"

## Output Format (Natural language, will be embedded in reviewer prompt)

Structure your output EXACTLY as follows:

## Thread: "【Thread theme name based on actual content, 3-8 characters】"

---

### TIER 1: Critical Details (Must preserve accurately)

**[Chunk ID] 【Chunk label】 [retention: X, importance: Y]**

Verification: ACCURATE (Details + key terms must be precise)

Original source:
<source>
【Full original text from source_sentences, joined with spaces】
</source>

Requirements:
- ✓ 【Specific requirement 1, e.g., "Must mention core concept A"】
- ✓ 【Specific requirement 2, e.g., "Must include key term B with accurate meaning"】
- ~ Phrasing can be adjusted, but meaning must not deviate

---

### TIER 2: Important Facts (Core meaning must be present)

**[Chunk ID] 【Chunk label】 [retention: X]**

Verification: SEMANTIC (Core facts must exist, wording flexible)

Core facts:
- 【Abstract fact 1, focus on WHAT information, not HOW it's worded】
- 【Abstract fact 2】

Flexibility: 【Note about acceptable variations】

---

### TIER 3: Narrative Logic (Logical connections must exist)

**[Chunk ID] 【Chunk label】 [importance: X]**

Verification: PRESENT (Logic necessary, mention sufficient)

Logical requirement:
→ 【Imperative checkpoint, e.g., "Reader must understand X led to Y"】
→ 【Mention requirement, e.g., "Must indicate someone introduced him to the army"】

---

### TIER 4: Optional Context (Nice to have)

**[Chunk ID] 【Chunk label】 [retention: relevant]**

Verification: OPTIONAL (Preserve if space allows)

Context: 【Brief description of background info】

Impact if missing: 【Assessment of impact, e.g., "Minor, doesn't affect core understanding"】

---

## Summary for Reviewer:
- TIER 1: X chunks → Must strictly verify details
- TIER 2: X chunks → Core facts cannot be lost
- TIER 3: X chunks → Logical integrity check
- TIER 4: X chunks → Optional

Priority: Focus on TIER 1-2, then TIER 3 if critical for coherence

---

## Important Guidelines:

1. **Thread naming:** Name based on what the chunks actually discuss (thread's real content), not user's general intent

2. **Tier assignment logic:**
   - If retention AND importance both exist → Usually TIER 1
   - If only retention exists → TIER 1 (detailed/verbatim) or TIER 2 (focused) or TIER 4 (relevant)
   - If only importance exists → TIER 3
   - If neither exists → TIER 4

3. **Source text attachment:**
   - ONLY attach for TIER 1 chunks (detailed verification needed)
   - Do NOT attach for TIER 2-4 (saves context space)

4. **Requirements style:**
   - TIER 1: Precise, term-focused ("Must include X", "Must preserve Y concept")
   - TIER 2: Abstract, fact-focused ("Core meaning: X did Y")
   - TIER 3: Imperative, logic-focused ("→ Must explain how X happened")
   - TIER 4: Descriptive, context-focused ("Background: X was happening")

5. **Only use information explicitly stated in source sentences** - do not add facts from general knowledge

6. **Generate abstract core facts, not specific phrasings** (for TIER 2):
   - ✅ GOOD: "Multiple family members died in rapid succession"
   - ❌ BAD: "On June 6th father died, June 9th brother died..." (too specific)

7. **User intent consideration:**
   - Higher retention level = more aligned with user intent = stricter verification
   - Book-coherence chunks (importance only) = looser verification, just check logical presence

**Your output will be directly used as the reviewer's instruction manual. Be clear, structured, and actionable.**

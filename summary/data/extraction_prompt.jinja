You are reading a long text and need to extract key information while maintaining continuity.

**Task:**
Extract 1-3 key pieces of information from the new text segment that are important for understanding the narrative.

**Requirements:**
1. Each piece of information should be:
   - A meaningful unit (events, character actions, important facts)
   - Have a concise label (5-15 characters) summarizing the topic
   - Have full content description (one sentence)
   - Can be connected to existing working memory AND/OR other chunks extracted from the same text segment

2. Do NOT repeat information already in working memory

**Current Working Memory:**
{{ working_memory }}

**New Text Segment:**
{{ new_text }}

**Output Format (JSON only, no other text):**

CRITICAL: You MUST output in this EXACT structure with "chunks" FIRST, then "links" SECOND:

{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "temp_id": "A",
      "label": "brief topic label (5-15 chars)",
      "content": "full description of the key information",
      "source_sentences": ["original sentence 1 from text", "original sentence 2 from text"]
    },
    {
      "temp_id": "B",
      "label": "another topic label",
      "content": "another description",
      "source_sentences": ["original sentence from text"]
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {"from": 1, "to": "A"},
    {"from": "A", "to": "B"},
    {"from": 3, "to": "B"}
  ]
}

**Explanation:**
- "chunks": Array of new information extracted from the text (use temp_id like "A", "B", "C")
  - "source_sentences": Array of original sentences from the text that this chunk is based on (copy exact text)
- "links": Array of relationships between chunks
  - "from" can be: working memory ID (number) OR temp_id (string from chunks above)
  - "to" can be: working memory ID (number) OR temp_id (string from chunks above)
  - Typically "to" points to newly extracted chunks
  - Use empty array [] if no relationships exist

**IMPORTANT:** The order matters! Output "chunks" FIRST, then "links" SECOND.

Remember: Extract only the most important information that advances the narrative or adds crucial context.
